    title: 'How Scoring Works',
    content: `
Detection scores are calculated by adding up points from different types of evidence:

‚Ä¢ Endpoint Evidence: +11 points
  File or process detection on your machine

‚Ä¢ LLM Classification: +5 points
  AI analysis of the detection context

‚Ä¢ Network Evidence: +3 points
  Network traffic patterns detected

‚Ä¢ Registry Match: -6 points
  MCP is registered and approved

The final score determines the classification:
‚Ä¢ Authorized (‚â§4): Safe to use
‚Ä¢ Suspect (5-8): Needs review
‚Ä¢ Unauthorized (‚â•9): High risk
    `.trim()
  },
  classification: {
    title: 'Classification Levels',
    content: `
MCPeeker uses three classification levels:

üü¢ Authorized (Score ‚â§ 4)
MCPs that are registered and approved, or have very low-risk indicators. These are safe to use.

üü° Suspect (Score 5-8)
MCPs that have some risk indicators but may be legitimate. These should be reviewed and registered if valid.

üî¥ Unauthorized (Score ‚â• 9)
MCPs with high-risk indicators or multiple evidence sources. These require immediate investigation and should not be used until cleared.

  evidence: {
    title: 'Evidence Types',
    content: `
MCPeeker collects evidence from multiple sources:

üíª Endpoint Evidence
Files (manifest.json) and processes detected on your machine. This is the primary detection method.

üåê Network Evidence
Traffic patterns detected by network monitoring tools (Zeek/Suricata). Provides supporting evidence.

ü§ñ LLM Classification
AI analysis using Claude that examines the context and provides plain-language explanations.

‚úÖ Registry Status
Whether the MCP is registered and approved in the organization's registry.
    `.trim()
  },
  registry: {
    title: 'Registry System',
    content: `
The registry is your organization's approved list of MCPs:

1. Register Your MCP
   If you're running a legitimate MCP, register it through the UI by providing:
   - Purpose and business justification
   - Team/owner information
   - Expected lifetime (TTL)

2. Approval Process
   Platform engineers review and approve registrations. Once approved, future detections of your MCP will be classified as "Authorized".

3. Benefits
   - Reduces false positives
   - Provides visibility into MCP usage
   - Maintains security oversight
    `.trim()
  },
  investigation: {
    title: 'Investigation Workflow',
    content: `
Security analysts can investigate detections:

1. Review Evidence
   Examine all evidence types (endpoint, network, LLM) to understand what was detected.

2. Provide Feedback
   Mark detections as:
   - True Positive: Real security concern
   - False Positive: Legitimate but not registered
   - Investigation Needed: Requires more analysis
   - Escalation Required: Serious issue

3. Collaborate
   Add notes to investigations, track progress, and resolve issues as a team.

4. Resolution
   Close investigations with resolution notes once the issue is addressed.
