# Specification Quality Checklist: MCP Detection Platform

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality - PASS

- ✅ No Go, Python, React, FastAPI, ClickHouse, or other tech stack mentioned in user stories
- ✅ Focuses on detection accuracy, developer experience, and security outcomes
- ✅ Written in business language (developers, analysts, platform engineers, not "backend engineers")
- ✅ All sections present: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Assumptions

### Requirement Completeness - PASS

- ✅ Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all details filled with reasonable defaults from PRD/constitution
- ✅ All 30 functional requirements are testable (e.g., FR-011 "within 60 seconds", FR-014 "expose Prometheus metrics")
- ✅ All 15 success criteria are measurable with specific thresholds (e.g., SC-002 "≤10%", SC-006 "400ms at 95th percentile")
- ✅ Success criteria avoid implementation (e.g., "System detects" not "ClickHouse stores", "Dashboard queries" not "API responds")
- ✅ 5 user stories each have 4 acceptance scenarios in Given/When/Then format
- ✅ 8 edge cases identified covering IP changes, containerization, JSON-RPC false positives, service failures
- ✅ Scope bounded by 5 user stories with clear priorities (P1 core detection, P2 investigation, P3 admin)
- ✅ Assumptions section lists 10 dependencies (network infrastructure, OS compatibility, certificate management)

### Feature Readiness - PASS

- ✅ Each FR maps to acceptance scenarios (e.g., FR-006 registration → US1 scenarios 2-3)
- ✅ User stories cover complete flows: US1 (detection→registration), US2 (investigation), US3 (lifecycle), US4 (correlation), US5 (transparency)
- ✅ Success criteria directly measure user story outcomes (SC-003 "3 minute registration" validates US1, SC-014 "5 minute investigation" validates US2)
- ✅ No leakage: Constitution mentions Go/Python/Zeek but spec describes "endpoint scanner", "network monitoring", "classification service" generically

## Notes

All checklist items pass. The specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` (if needed) or `/speckit.plan`.

Key strengths:
- Technology-agnostic language throughout user scenarios and success criteria
- Comprehensive coverage with 30 FRs, 15 SCs, and 5 prioritized user stories
- Clear acceptance criteria for every requirement
- Realistic edge cases identified from enterprise deployment context
- Bounded scope with explicit assumptions about infrastructure dependencies

No issues requiring spec updates.
