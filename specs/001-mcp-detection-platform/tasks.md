### User Story Dependencies

- **US1 + US4 (P1 stories)**: Can start in parallel after Foundational phase - US1 focuses on endpoint detection + registration, US4 focuses on correlation
- **US2 (P2)**: Requires US1 (detection data) and US4 (correlation working) to provide investigation functionality
- **US5 (P2)**: Can start in parallel with US2 after US4 completes - adds Judge service and transparency features
- **US3 (P3)**: Requires US1 (registry exists) to add approval workflows - can be done last

### Within Each User Story

1. Models and schemas first (database tables, API contracts)
2. Core services second (scanner, correlator, judge logic)
3. API endpoints third (REST endpoints, NATS publishers)
4. Frontend components last (UI for user interaction)

### Parallel Opportunities

**Within Setup (Phase 1)**:
- T002-T011 can all run in parallel (different projects, independent initialization)

**Within Foundational (Phase 2)**:
- T016-T021 (utilities), T030-T034 (metrics) can run in parallel
- T026-T029 (mTLS) can run in parallel

**Between User Stories**:
- After Foundational completes:
  - Developer A: US1 (T035-T052) - Endpoint detection + registration
  - Developer B: US4 (T053-T068) - Correlation + scoring
  - Once US1+US4 done:
    - Developer C: US2 (T069-T080) - Investigation
    - Developer D: US5 (T081-T094) - Transparency

**Within Polish (Phase 8)**:
- T107-T112 (analytics), T113-T116 (performance), T117-T120 (security), T121-T126 (deployment), T127-T131 (docs) can all run in parallel

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (P1 User Stories Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T011)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T012-T034) - **CRITICAL BLOCKER**
3. Complete Phase 3: US1 - Detection + Registration (T035-T052)
4. Complete Phase 4: US4 - Multi-Layer Correlation (T053-T068)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test US1 + US4 independently
6. Deploy/demo MVP with core detection and correlation working

### Incremental Delivery

1. Setup + Foundational â†’ Foundation ready (infrastructure deployed)
2. Add US1 â†’ Test independently â†’ Developers can see detections and self-register (MVP!)
3. Add US4 â†’ Test independently â†’ Multi-layer correlation reduces false positives
4. Add US2 â†’ Test independently â†’ Analysts can investigate and provide feedback
5. Add US5 â†’ Test independently â†’ Developers understand why their MCP was flagged
6. Add US3 â†’ Test independently â†’ Platform engineers manage registry lifecycle
7. Polish â†’ Production-ready with analytics, performance, security hardening

### Parallel Team Strategy

With 4 developers after Foundational phase completes:

- **Developer A**: US1 (detection + registration) - T035-T052
- **Developer B**: US4 (correlation + scoring) - T053-T068
- **Developer C**: US2 (investigation + feedback) after US1+US4 - T069-T080
- **Developer D**: US5 (Judge + transparency) after US4 - T081-T094

Then all developers collaborate on US3 and Polish phase.

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies - can run in parallel
- **[US#] labels**: Map task to specific user story for traceability
- **Each user story independently testable**: Validate after each phase completion
- **No test tasks**: Spec does not explicitly request tests - focus on implementation
- **File paths**: All paths absolute from repository root per requirements
- **Constitution compliance**: All tasks reference FR/SC requirements from spec.md
- **Avoid**: Vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
- **Commit strategy**: Commit after each task or logical group for rollback safety
- **Stop at checkpoints**: Validate each user story works independently before proceeding
