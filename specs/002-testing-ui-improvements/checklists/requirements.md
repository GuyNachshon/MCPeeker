# Specification Quality Checklist: Testing and UI Improvements for Registry Match Classification

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-18
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality: PASS ✅

The specification is written without implementation details and focuses on user value:
- User stories describe what platform engineers, QA engineers, and SOC analysts need
- No mention of specific testing frameworks, UI libraries, or technical implementation
- All sections completed (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Assumptions, Dependencies)

### Requirement Completeness: PASS ✅

All requirements are clear and testable:
- FR-001 through FR-012 are specific and measurable
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- Success criteria include specific metrics (100% coverage, 30 second test runtime, 2 second identification time, 95% usability)
- Edge cases identified (expired entries, API unavailability, composite ID collisions, real-time transitions, malformed data)
- Scope clearly bounded with Out of Scope section

### Feature Readiness: PASS ✅

The feature is ready for planning:
- Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- User scenarios cover all primary flows (unit tests, integration tests, UI improvements, optional configuration)
- Dependencies clearly identified (recent correlator fix, registry API, scanner manual triggers, frontend build tooling, NATS)

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan`
- All quality checks passed on first iteration
- No clarifications needed - feature scope is well-defined based on recent scoring fix
- Optional feature (US4 - weight adjustment) appropriately marked as P3 priority
