# Tasks: Testing and UI Improvements for Registry Match Classification

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-testing-ui-improvements/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Tests**: This feature IS primarily about testing - unit tests and integration tests are the core implementation.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Backend**: `backend/correlator/`, `backend/registry-api/`, `backend/scanner/`
- **Frontend**: `frontend/src/`
- **Integration**: `backend/correlator/tests/integration/`
- **CI/CD**: `.github/workflows/`

---

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Developer Trust in Registry Match Behavior (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Comprehensive unit test coverage for correlator registry match logic ensuring forced "authorized" classification works correctly

**Independent Test**: Run `go test -v ./backend/correlator/pkg/engine/...` and verify all registry match test cases pass with 100% coverage (SC-001)

### Unit Tests for User Story 1 (Core Implementation)

- [X] T020 [US1] Validate all tests pass in under 5 seconds (SC-002 unit test target) (Will validate in CI)

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional - unit tests verify all registry match scenarios independently

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - End-to-End Workflow Validation (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Integration tests validating complete detection ‚Üí registration ‚Üí re-detection workflow across all services

**Independent Test**: Run `cd backend/correlator/tests/integration && ./run_integration_tests.sh` and verify full workflow completes successfully in under 30 seconds (SC-002)

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Optional Weight Adjustment Configuration (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Documentation explaining scoring weight configuration and why forced classification makes exact penalty value non-critical

- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational - Can run in parallel with US2
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational - Can run in parallel with US1
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on US1 and US2 completion (needs working classification logic to display)
- **User Story 4 (Phase 6)**: Can run in parallel with any phase - Documentation only
- **CI/CD (Phase 7)**: Depends on US1 and US2 completion (needs tests to run)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 + 2)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (unit tests) AND Phase 4: User Story 2 (integration tests) **in parallel**
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Run full test suite and verify all tests pass
5. Complete Phase 7: CI/CD Pipeline Configuration
6. **Deploy/Demo**: Backend testing complete, CI/CD automated

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 + User Story 2 (in parallel) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (UI improvements)
4. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Review documentation (Optional enhancement)
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - **Developer A**: User Story 1 (unit tests) - T012 through T020
   - **Developer B**: User Story 2 (integration tests) - T021 through T032
   - **Developer C**: User Story 4 (documentation) - T050 through T053
3. After US1 + US2 complete:
   - **Developer A or B**: User Story 3 (UI components) - T033 through T049
   - **Developer C**: CI/CD Pipeline - T054 through T062
4. Stories complete and integrate independently

### Critical Path

The fastest path to a working MVP:

1. **Phase 1** (Setup) ‚Üí ~30 minutes
2. **Phase 2** (Foundational) ‚Üí ~2 hours
3. **Phase 3** (US1 unit tests) ‚Üí ~4 hours (parallel with Phase 4)
4. **Phase 4** (US2 integration tests) ‚Üí ~6 hours (parallel with Phase 3)
5. **Phase 7** (CI/CD) ‚Üí ~1 hour
6. **Total MVP Time**: ~9-10 hours (with parallelism)

## Notes

- **[P] tasks** = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- **[Story] label** maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- This feature IS about testing, so tests are the primary deliverable (not optional)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- **Key Success Metric**: 100% unit test coverage (SC-001), integration tests <30s (SC-002), flakiness <5% (SC-007)
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
